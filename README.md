### CICD Best Practices
- Keep Your Pipelines Fast
- Isolate and Secure Your CI/CD Environment
- Make the CI/CD Pipeline the Only Way to Deploy to Production
- Run Your Fastest Tests Early
- Run Tests Locally Before Committing to the CI/CD Pipeline


### What are the tools available to create CICD pipeline?
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- TeamCity
- Travis CI
- CodeShip


### Difference between Continuous delivery and continuous deployment
Before you consider which of these practices to implement, determine if your organization has a DevOps culture that can support them. 
Next, because DevOps teams strive to automate the entire software delivery process, the question is not “which one is better?” 
Instead ask, “do we need a manual trigger between continuous integration and continuous delivery?”

If you answered yes to all, you may want to consider practicing continuous deployment and automate software delivery completely—from code commit to production.

If you answered no to any, you may need to start with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). 
You’ll automate the creation of production-ready code that’s always just one manual approval from deployment. 
Over time, you can work toward continuous deployment and full automation of your software delivery process.
